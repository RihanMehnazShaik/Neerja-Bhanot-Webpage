            <p style=" background-color: #393831;color: bisque;padding:10px;">MARRIAGE</p>
            <p>In March 1985, Neerja Bhanot entered into an arranged marriage with a businessman from the Gulf region. This decision was in keeping with traditional practices, but it soon became clear that the marriage was not a happy one. Neerja moved to the Gulf with her husband, anticipating a new phase in her life. However, the reality of her marital situation quickly began to deteriorate.
                Her husband, reportedly abusive and demanding, placed significant strain on their relationship. The issues included physical and emotional abuse and ongoing demands for dowry, which created an intolerable environment for Neerja. Despite her initial hopes and efforts to make the marriage work, the situation became increasingly untenable.
                Neerja faced immense pressure and challenges, particularly given the societal expectations and norms of the time. However, she chose to prioritize her own well-being and principles over enduring an unhappy and abusive relationship. Within two months, Neerja made the courageous decision to leave her husband and return to India. This decision was particularly bold given the cultural context and societal norms around marriage and divorce in conservative Indian society.
                Her return to India marked a significant turning point in her life. It was a period of self-discovery and transition as she sought to rebuild her life independently. Neerja’s decision to leave the marriage reflected her resilience, self-respect, and determination to live according to her own values, despite societal pressures.</p>

            <p style=" background-color: #393831;color: bisque;padding:10px;">CAREER</p>
            <p>After her return to India, Neerja Bhanot embarked on a new chapter in her life by applying for a flight attendant position with Pan American World Airways (Pan Am). In a highly competitive selection process, she was chosen from among thousands of applicants. Neerja excelled in the rigorous training program conducted in Miami, which equipped her with the skills and knowledge required for the role.</p>
            <p>Upon completing her training, Neerja returned to India as a purser, a senior flight attendant responsible for managing the cabin crew and ensuring passenger comfort. Her exceptional work ethic, dedication, and empathetic nature quickly earned her the respect and admiration of both her colleagues and passengers. Neerja became a cherished member of the Pan Am team, known for her professionalism and commitment to delivering outstanding service.</p>

                <p style=" background-color: #393831;color: bisque;padding:10px;">HIJACKING</p>
                <p> On September 5, 1986, Pan Am Flight 73, a Boeing 747 on its journey from Mumbai to New York City with a stopover in Karachi, faced a harrowing crisis. The flight was hijacked by four terrorists from the Abu Nidal Organization at Karachi International Airport. Armed and determined, the hijackers sought to use the plane as a weapon, demanding ransom and the release of Palestinian prisoners.</p>

<p>Amidst this chaos, Neerja Bhanot, the senior flight purser, emerged as a beacon of bravery. With remarkable presence of mind, she discreetly informed the cockpit crew, enabling their escape through an emergency exit. Neerja's leadership and calm under pressure were vital as she managed the unfolding situation, reassured passengers, and orchestrated an evacuation. Her unwavering dedication was instrumental in opening emergency exits and guiding passengers to safety.</p>

<p>Tragically, Neerja was shot while courageously shielding three children from the gunfire. Her heroic actions, though leading to her untimely death, saved many lives and highlighted her extraordinary selflessness. The hijacking lasted for approximately 17 hours, and Neerja’s bravery remains a powerful testament to her character.</p>
